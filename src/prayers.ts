'Serenity': `God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.`,
'Third Step': `God, I offer myself to Theeâ€” To build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt. Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy will. Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love, and Thy Way of life. May I do Thy will always!
  `,
'Seventh Step': `My Creator, I am now willing that you should have all of me, good and bad. I pray that you now remove from me every single defect of character which stands in the way of my usefulness to you and my fellows. Grant me strength, as I go out from here, to do your bidding. Amen.`,
'Saint Francis': `Lord, make me an instrument of your peace- That Where there is hatred, I may bring love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; where there is sadness, joy....`,
'Set Aside': `Dear God, please help me to set aside everything I think I know about myself, my disease, these steps, and especially about You; So I may have an open mind and a new experience with all these things. Please help me to see the truth.`,
'Resentment': `God, please help me to show tolerance, pity, and patience toward this person that I would cheerfully grant a sick friend. This is a sick man. How can I be helpful to him? God, save me from being angry. Thy will be done.`,
